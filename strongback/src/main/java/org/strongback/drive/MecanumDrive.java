/**
 * Control logic for a {@link MecanumDrive mecanum drive system}. This controller provides
 * {@link #absoluteCartesian(double, double, double) cartesian} and {@link #relativePolar(double, double, double) polar} inputs.
 * <p>
 * This drive train will work for these configurations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Mecanum - 4 mecanum wheels on the four corners of the robot; or</li>
 * <li>Holonomic - 4 omni wheels arranged so that the front and back wheels are toed in 45 degrees, which form an X across the
 * robot when viewed from above.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This drive implements {@link Requirable} so that {@link Command}s can use it directly when {@link Command#execute()
 * executing}.
 *
 * <p>
 * <em>NOTE: This class is experimental and needs to be thoroughly tested and debugged using actual hardware.</em>
