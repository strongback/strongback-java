/**
 * A hardware-based Proportional Integral Differential (PID) controller that runs on the Talon SRX motor controller. The
 * controller's input is wired as a sensor on the Talon SRX device, and specified via the
 * {@link #setFeedbackDevice(FeedbackDevice)} method. The controller's mode of control is set via the
 * {@link #setControlMode(ControlMode)}.
 * <h2>Important usage notes</h2>
 * <p>
 * This section outlines some useful and frequently used features of the TalonController.
 * <h3>Ramp rate</h3>
 * <p>
 * The Talon SRX can be set to honor a ramp rate to prevent instantaneous changes in throttle. This ramp rate is in effect
 * regardless of which mode is selected (throttle, slave, or closed-loop).
 *
 * <pre>
 * controller.setVoltageRampRate(6.0); // Allow throttle changes up to 6.0V per second
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Feedback device</h3>
 * <p>
 * The analog and quadrature signals are available all the time in all modes (throttle, slave, or closed-loop), but the Talon
 * SRX requires the robot application to "pick" a particular feedback device for soft limit and closed-loop features. The Talon
 * SRX defaults to the {@link org.strongback.components.TalonSRX.FeedbackDevice#QUADRATURE_ENCODER quadrature encoder}.
 *
 * <pre>
 * controller.setFeedbackDevice(FeedbackDevice.ANALOG_ENCODER);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * In order for limit switches and closed-loop features to function correctly, the sensor and motor have to be 'in-phase'. This
 * means that the sensor position must move in a <i>positive</i> direction as the motor controller drives <i>positive</i>
 * throttle. To test this, first drive the motor manually (using a human input device), and watch the sensor position either in
 * the roboRIO Web-based Configuration Self-Test, or by calling {@link #getSelectedSensor()} and printing it to console. If the
 * "Sensor Position" moves in a negative direction while Talon SRX throttle is positive (blinking green), then use the
 * {@link #reverseSensor(boolean)} so that the Talon negates the sensor reading. Then re-test to confirm sensed position moves
 * in a positive direction with positive motor drive.
 * <p>
 * In the special case of using the {@link org.strongback.components.TalonSRX.FeedbackDevice#ENCODER_RISING} feedback device,
 * {@link #reverseSensor(boolean)} should be called with <code>false</code>, since a rising encoder is guaranteed to be positive
 * since it increments per rising edge, and never decrements.
 *
 * <h3>Soft limits</h3>
 * <p>
 * Soft limits can be used to disable motor drive when the position value read from the feedback device is outside of a
 * specified range. Forward throttle will be disabled when {@link #enableForwardSoftLimit(boolean)} is set to <code>true</code>
 * and the sensor position is greater than the {@link #setForwardSoftLimit(int)} value. Reverse throttle will be disabled when
 * {@link #enableReverseSoftLimit(boolean)} is set to <code>true</code> and the sensor position is less than the
 * {@link #setReverseSoftLimit(int)}.
 *
 * <h3>Control modes</h3>
 * <p>
 * The closed-loop logic is the same regardless of which feedback sensor or closed-loop mode is selected.
 *
 *
 * <h3>Follower mode</h3>
 * <p>
 * Any Talon SRX on CAN bus can be instructed to "follow" the drive output of another Talon SRX. This is done by putting a Talon
 * SRX into "follower" mode and specifying the device ID of the "lead Talon". The follower Talon will then mirror the output of
 * the leader, which can be in any mode: closed-loop, voltage percent (duty-cycle), or even following yet another Talon SRX.
 *
 * <pre>
 * leaderController = ...
 * followerController.setControlMode(ControlMode.FOLLOWER);
 * followerController.withTarget(leaderController.getDeviceID());
 * </pre>
 *
 * The {@link #reverseOutput(boolean)} method can be used to invert the output of a follower Talon. This may be useful if a
 * follower and leader Talon are wired out of phase with each other.
 * <p>
 * This class is currently experimental. It certainly works as a simple motor, but most of this interface exposes functionality
 * of the Talon SRX motor controller, including various input sensors. Little beyond setting and reading the speed has been
 * tested.
