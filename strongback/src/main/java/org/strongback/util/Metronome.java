/**
 * A class that can be used to perform an action at a regular interval. To use, set up a {@code Metronome} instance and perform
 * a repeated event (perhaps using a loop), calling {@link #pause()} before each event.
 * <p>
 * There are several implementations provided by this class, and each varies in the precision of the interval based upon the
 * supplied {@link Clock}, interval, and the technique used to pause. Among these implementations, the
 * {@link #busy(long, TimeUnit, Clock)} method produces the most accurate, precise, and consistent pause intervals down to 1
 * millisecond on most platforms (especially modern Linux and OS X).
