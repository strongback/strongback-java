/**
 * Access point for a number of the higher-level Strongback functions. This class can be used within robot code or within unit
 * tests.
 * <h2>Introduction</h2>
 * <p>
 * Strongback is an open source Java library that makes it easier for you to write and test your robot code for FIRST Robotics
 * Competition. You use it along with WPILib for Java, and you deploy it and your codebase to your RoboRIO.
 * <p>
 * Strongback is:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Simple</b> - Strongback's API is simple and natural, and it uses Java 8 lambdas and fluent APIs extensively to keep
 * your code simple and readable.</li>
 * <li><b>Safe</b> - Strongback itself uses WPILib for Java and all of its built-in safety mechanisms, so there are no surprises
 * and behavior remains consistent.</li>
 * <li><b>Testable</b> - When your code uses Strongback, you can test much more of your robot code on your computer without
 * requiring real robot hardware.</li>
 * <li><b>Timely</b> - Strongback's commands and asynchronous functions share a single dedicated thread. This dramatically
 * reduces context switches in the JVM, and on the dual-core RoboRIO results in consistent and reliable periods required for
 * control system logic.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Configuration</h2>
 * <p>
 * Strongback is designed with sensible defaults, so you can start using it right away with almost no code. However, if the
 * defaults are not ideal for your own robot, you can change Strongback's configuration when your robot is initialized, often in
 * the {@link edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.IterativeRobot#robotInit()} method. For example, the following code fragment sets the log
 * message level of detail, the amount of time between work cycles, and specifies that no measurements or events will be
 * recorded:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Strongback.configure()
 *           .setLogLevel(Logger.Level.INFO)
 *           .useExecutionPeriod(20, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
 *           .recodNoData()
 *           .recordNoEvents();
 * </pre>
 *
 * These happen to be the default settings, but you can easily use some or all of these methods with different parameters to
 * alter Strongback's behavior.
 * <p>
 * Note that all such configuration should be performed in the robot initialization and not changed. Strongback simply will not
 * recognize any changes when it is running.
 *
 * <h2>Starting and disabling</h2>
 * <p>
 * Strongback will only run when you tell it to {@link #start()}, so be sure to do this in your robot code. For example, if your
 * robot extends {@link IterativeRobot} then it should start Strongback in autonomous and teleoperated modes, and should
 * {@link #disable()} Strongback when the robot is disabled:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  public void autonomousInit() {
 *       Strongback.start();
 *       ...
 *   }
 *
 *  public void teleopInit() {
 *       Strongback.start();
 *       ...
 *  }
 *
 *   public void disabledInit() {
 *       Strongback.disable();
 *       ...
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Stopping versus disabling</h3>
 * <p>
 * When the robot is disabled we recommend calling {@link #disable()} rather than {@link #stop()}, since {@link #disable()} will
 * stop things from executing but will keep most of the services ready to run again. If you prefer, you can use {@link #stop()}
 * to completely shutdown all Strongback resources when needed, although on most robots and during most competitions
 * {@link #disable()} should be sufficient.
 *
 * <h2>Execution</h2>
 * <p>
 * Strongback runs all of its functionality in a separate thread on a
 * {@link Strongback.Configurator#useExecutionPeriod(long, TimeUnit) configurable} regular interval. That means that every
 * <em>n</em> milliseconds (where <em>n</em> is {@link Strongback.Configurator#useExecutionPeriod(long, TimeUnit)
 * configurable}), this executor thread will perform the following functions:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Calling new or still-running commands</li>
 * <li>Reacting when switches change state (optional)</li>
 * <li>Recording data measurements (optional)</li>
 * <li>Recording events (optional)</li>
 * <li>Calling custom {@link Executor} implementations that you {@link #executor() register} (optional)</li>
 * </ul>
 * Each of these is described in more detail in the sections that follow.
 * <p>
 * Note that it is important for Strongback's executor thread to stay on its regular cycle so, for example, your feedback or
 * feed-forward control logic is called with actual time intervals that match those used when computing those models. Therefore,
 * it is important to know when your commands, switch reaction functions, and even custom {@link Executable} components take too
 * long to execute. By default, Strongback will report such problems to System.out, but you can instead supply your own
 * {@link Strongback.Configurator#reportExcessiveExecutionTimes handler}.
 *
 * <h3>Commands</h3>
 * <p>
 * Strongbackâ€™s command framework makes it easier to write robot code that does multiple things at once, and provide a very
 * simple, composable, and testable way to write your robot code to control these different activities. Commands can be used in
 * both autonomous and teleoperated modes, and typically represent actions or sequences of actions you want your robot to
 * perform. For example, you might have a command to raise an arm on your robot to a specific angle, or another to close or open
 * a claw, or another to shoot a game piece. When you want your robot to do one of those things you simply submit the command to
 * Strongback for execution and forget about it. While your robot is doing other things during teleoperated or autonomous modes,
 * Strongback will continue running your command until it completes or until another command preempts it.
 * <p>
 * When you use Strongback commands, you write a <em>command class</em> with logic to control the different parts of your robot.
 * You can even create larger and more complex commands, called <em>command groups</em>, by composing them from a number of
 * smaller, more atomic commands. Then at the appropriate time, your code creates an instance of a command and
 * {@link #submit(Command) submits it} to Strongback's scheduler, whose job is to maintain a list of all submitted commands and,
 * using Strongback's executor thread, periodically go through this list and give each command an opportunity to execute. The
 * scheduler removes a command when that command tells the scheduler it has finished completes, or if/when the scheduler
 * receives a new command that preempts it.
 * <p>
 * Strongback's scheduler is run once per cycle of Strongback's executor thread. And because the thread runs regularly with a
 * constant interval, you can use this <em>time interval</em> in your control algorithms.
 *
 * <h3>Switch states</h3>
 * <p>
 * Another thing your robot probably needs to do periodically is check the state of buttons and switches so you can do things:
 * <ul>
 * <li>when a button is pressed or a switch is triggered;</li>
 * <li>when a button is released or a switch is untriggered;</li>
 * <li>while a button is pressed or a switch is triggered; or</li>
 * <li>while a button is released or a switch is untriggered;</li>
 * </ul>
 * This is so useful that Strongback includes a {@link #switchReactor() switch reactor}. Simply register a {@link Switch} object
 * and the function that you want to call when the state changes, and Strongback takes care of watching the switches, tracking
 * their states, and calling your functions when necessary.
 * <p>
 * Strongback's switch reactor works only with {@link Switch}es, but a {@link Switch} is a <em>functional interface</em> that
 * defines a single {@link Switch#isTriggered()} method. So any method that can be called frequently and that returns a
 * {@code boolean} can be treated as a switch.
 * <p>
 * For example, if your robot has a firing mechanism, you might define a {@code FireRepeatedly} command that begins to fire
 * until the {@code StopFiring} command is submitted. Say you want your robot to fire repeatedly while the driver presses and
 * holds the {@link Gamepad}'s right button, then you can implement this with the following:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   SwitchReactor reactor = Strongback.switchReactor();
 *   Gamepad gamepad = ...
 *   reactor.onTriggeredSubmit(gamepad.getRightTrigger(),FireRepeatedly::new);
 *   reactor.onUnTriggeredSubmit(gamepad.getRightTrigger(),StopFiring::new);
 * </pre>
 *
 * That's it! This example may look strange if you're not used to Java 8 lambdas, but it basically will create and submit a new
 * {@code FireRepeatedly} command whenever the right trigger button (which is a {@link Switch}) is pressed, and will create and
 * submit a new {@code StopFiring} command whenever that button is released.
 * <p>
 * Strongback's switch reactor is easy to use, and it's automatically checked once every other cycle of Strongback's executor
 * thread. However, you can easily {@link Strongback.Configurator#disableSwitchReactor() disable} the {@link SwitchReactor} if
 * you don't find it useful.
 *
 * <h3>Recording data</h3>
 * <p>
 * Strongback's data recorder runs on Strongback's executor thread and periodically records measurements of various
 * <em>channels</em> of continuous values. The measurements and the time are appended to a data to a file on the RoboRIO. After
 * your robot runs, you can download and post-process the file(s) to extract time histories of for each of the channels, and
 * visualize them using tools like Excel or Tableau to visualize those histories.
 * <p>
 * Any function that returns a double or integer value can be registered as a named channel using Strongback's DataRecorder
 * object accessed via the {@link #dataRecorder()} method. For example, the following fragment of code shows how you might
 * register your robot's battery voltage, current usage, motor speeds, button/switch states, accelerometer readings, and other
 * metrics:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public void robotInit() {
 *    ...
 *    Motor left = Motor.compose(Hardware.Motors.talon(1), Hardware.Motors.talon(2));
 *    Motor right = Motor.compose(Hardware.Motors.talon(3), Hardware.Motors.talon(4)).invert();
 *    TankDrive drive = new TankDrive(left, right);
 *
 *    FlightStick joystick = Hardware.HumanInterfaceDevices.logitechAttack3D(1);
 *    ContinuousRange throttle = joystick.getThrottle();
 *    ContinuousRange sensitivity = throttle.map(t -&gt; (t + 1.0) / 2.0);
 *    ContinuousRange driveSpeed = joystick.getPitch().scale(sensitivity::read); // scaled
 *    ContinuousRange turnSpeed = joystick.getRoll().scale(sensitivity::read).invert(); // scaled and inverted
 *    Switch trigger = joystick.getTrigger();

 *
 *    // Get the RoboRIO's accelerometer ...
 *    ThreeAxisAccelerometer accel = Hardware.Accelerometers.builtIn();
 *    Accelerometer xAccel = accel.getXDirection();
 *    Accelerometer yAccel = accel.getYDirection();
 *    Accelerometer zAccel = accel.getZDirection();
 *    VoltageSensor battery = Hardware.powerPanel().getVoltageSensor();
 *    CurrentSensor current = Hardware.powerPanel().getCurrentSensor();
 *
 *    Strongback.dataRecorder()
 *              .register("Battery Volts",1000, battery)
 *              .register("Current load", 1000, current)
 *              .register("Left Motors",  left)
 *              .register("Right Motors", right)
 *              .register("Trigger",      trigger)
 *              .register("Throttle",     1000, throttle::read)
 *              .register("Drive Speed",  1000, driveSpeed::read)
 *              .register("Turn Speed",   1000, turnSpeed::read)
 *              .register("X-Accel",      1000, xAccel::getAcceleration)
 *              .register("Y-Accel",      1000, yAccel::getAcceleration)
 *              .register("Z-Accel",      ()-&gt;zAccel.getAcceleration()*1000));
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Technically the data recorder only records integer values, but as you can see any function that returns a double can be
 * scaled to an integer value (e.g., multiplied by 1000 and cast to an integer).
 * <p>
 * Strongback's data recorder makes it easy to record and measure what your robot is doing over time so you can visualize it and
 * help improve your robot's behavior. It does take CPU and time to make these measurements, so it's not really intended to be
 * used during competitions. So, by default Strongback does not actually record any data and you must enable it by defining
 * {@link Strongback.Configurator#recordDataToFile(String, int) where} the data should be recorded.
 * <p>
 * Strongback will only record data when you ask it to, so this is an "opt-in" feature. It's very useful during testing to
 * record and measure what your robot is doing over time so you can visualize it and help improve your robot's behavior, and you
 * can have your robot code configure {@link Strongback.Configurator#recordDataToFile(String, int) where} the data should be
 * written and register the various channels. After you finish a robot test, download and post-process the events file, combine
 * it with the recorded events (see next section), and use tools like Excel or Tableau to visualize those time histories.
 * <p>
 * Then, for a competition there is no reason to take out any of that code. Simply call
 * {@link Strongback.Configurator#recordNoData()} before {@link #start() starting} Strongback (perhaps based upon a
 * SmartDashboard setting), and Strongback will not record any of the data or call any of the functions you supplied with each
 * channel.
 *
 * <h3>Recording events</h3>
 * <p>
 * Strongback is also able to record non-continuous or infrequent <em>events</em> and the times at which they occur. These
 * events are recorded in a file, and you can combine these with the continuous data measurements to understand how these events
 * correlate with the measurements.
 * <p>
 * For example, if you want to record when a joystick button was pressed and released, you can use code like the following to
 * record an event for each case in your robot's {@code robotInit()} method:
 *
 * <pre>
 * public void robotInit() {
 *    ...
 *    Strongback.switchReactor().
 *              .onTriggered(joystick.getTrigger(), ()-&gt;Strongback.eventRecorder().record("Trigger",true))
 *              .onUnTriggered(joystick.getTrigger(), ()-&gt;Strongback.eventRecorder().record("Trigger",false));
 *    ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * It is often useful to know when various commands were submitted, when they began executing, and when the stopped executing or
 * were preempted by other commands. To enable recording of commands, simply call
 * {@link Strongback.Configurator#recordCommands()}.
 * <p>
 * Strongback will only record events when you ask it to, so this is an "opt-in" feature. It's very useful during testing, and
 * you can have your robot code configure {@link Strongback.Configurator#recordEventsToFile(String, long) where} the events
 * should be written as well as record various events of interest. After you finish a robot test, download and post-process the
 * events file, combine it with the recorded data, and use tools like Excel or Tableau to visualize those time histories.
 * <p>
 * Then, for a competition there is no reason to take out any of that code. Simply call
 * {@link Strongback.Configurator#recordNoEvents()} before {@link #start() starting} Strongback (perhaps based upon a
 * SmartDashboard setting), and Strongback will do nothing with the events that you record and will not write to the files.
